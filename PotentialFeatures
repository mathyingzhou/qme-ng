Here are what I'm doing to the program qme-ng:
1.Add comments. Translate all French terms to English.
2.Get the program to work on MacOSX.
In order for 2 to work we need to do several things:
a) Get GNU gmp. Use it.
b) Get Boost. Use it.
c) Compile and link the program.
If everything is successful I will write a manual on how to get qme-ng to work on MacOSX.
